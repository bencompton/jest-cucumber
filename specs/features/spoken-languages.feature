Feature: Spoken languages
  In order to work with Gherkin written in my native language
  As an engineer / team with a native language other than English
  I would like support for Gherkin keywords translated to my language

  Rule: Non-English Gherkin keywords in my feature files should be converted to their English equivalent before further processing in Jest Cucumber

  Rule: When a Gherkin keyword doesn't exist for my language, the default English equivalent should be used
